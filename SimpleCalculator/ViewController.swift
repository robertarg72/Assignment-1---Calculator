 * Project: SimpleCalculator
 * Name: Robert Argume
 * StudentID: 300949529
 * Description: Intermediate User Interactions Demo
 * Version: 0.2 - Added restrictions that work well with all iPhone simulators except for smaller
 * devices like SE, 5 and older versions.
 * Notes:
 *   - UI design and development was performed using the iPhone 8 View
 *   - For other "View As" options like Iphone 8 Plus, many restrictions show errors
